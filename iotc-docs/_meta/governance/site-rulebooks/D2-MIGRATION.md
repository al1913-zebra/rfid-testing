# Mermaid → D2 migration

> **Historical record.** This documents the original Mermaid → D2 conversion of **54** diagrams across 41 files. The corpus has since grown; the live site now renders **65** D2 diagrams (the figure quoted in `README.md`). Rows D09 and D46 below reference source pages (`fleet/management/read-config.md`, `reference/troubleshooting/bluetooth.md`) that have since been deleted.

### Diagram-type tally

| Mermaid type | Count | D2 target |
|---|---|---|
| `flowchart LR` | 33 | D2 default with `direction: right` |
| `flowchart TB` | 7 | D2 default (top-down implicit) |
| `flowchart TD` | 7 | D2 default (top-down implicit) |
| `sequenceDiagram` | 4 | D2 `shape: sequence_diagram` |
| `stateDiagram-v2` | 1 | D2 nodes + connections |
| `gantt` | 1 | D2 timeline (manual layout — D2 has no native gantt) |
| `xychart-beta` | 1 | Keep as inline `<img>` ascii chart OR rebuild in D2 (D2 has no native xychart) |

## 2. D2 language summary (the parts we use)

- **Shapes (default rectangle)**: `foo`, `foo: Label`, `foo.shape: cylinder` — full shape list: rectangle, square, page, parallelogram, document, cylinder, queue, package, step, callout, stored_data, person, diamond, oval, circle, hexagon, cloud, c4-person
- **Connections**: `a -> b` forward, `a <- b` backward, `a <-> b` bidirectional, `a -- b` undirected, `a -> b: edge label`
- **Containers**: `parent: { child1; child2 }` or `parent.child1 -> parent.child2`
- **Direction**: `direction: right` (LR equivalent), default is top-down; valid values up/down/right/left
- **Styling**: `node: { style: { fill: "#004C97"; stroke: "#003070"; font-color: white; border-radius: 4 } }`
- **Sequence diagrams**: `shape: sequence_diagram` at file scope, then ordered `actor -> actor: msg` lines
- **Theme config**: `vars: { d2-config: { theme-id: 0; dark-theme-id: 200 } }`

## 3. Theme decision

| Surface | Theme |
|---|---|
| Light mode | **`0` Neutral Default** — clean grey + subtle blue accents, doesn't fight Zebra navy brand |
| Dark mode | **`200` Dark Mauve** — only Dark Mauve and Dark Flagship Terrastruct available; Dark Mauve is the more muted of the two |

Picked by running `d2 themes` against the 0.7.1 CLI. The themes page on d2lang.com publishes preview images but no programmatic ID list — the CLI is the source of truth.

Themes considered and rejected:
- `100 Vanilla Nitro Cola` (remark-d2 default): warm pastels, clashes with the docs' cool navy
- `300 Terminal` / `301 Terminal Grayscale`: forces monospace + caps-lock label transform; too opinionated for engineering reference docs
- `4 Cool Classics`: blue-heavy but very saturated; would compete with the Zebra brand
- `8 Colorblind Clear`: strong distinct hues — useful for status decision trees, but overall too colorful for a content set this size

## 4. Docusaurus integration plan

### Prerequisites

1. **`d2` CLI on every machine that builds the docs** (local dev + GitHub Actions runner). Installed via Homebrew (`brew install d2`) locally; needs an install step in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for CI.
2. **`remark-d2` npm package** (the only published Docusaurus-aware D2 plugin, `mech-a/remark-d2`, currently at `^0.2.3`).
3. **Disable the existing Mermaid theme** once all diagrams are converted; until then, both can coexist (one fenced as ` ```mermaid `, the other as ` ```d2 `).

### Step action plan with fail-paths

| # | Action | Expected outcome | Likely failure mode → fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Install `d2` CLI locally: `brew install d2` | `d2 --version` prints `0.7.1` | `brew not found` → install Homebrew or use the install script from d2lang.com |
| 2 | Add a `Install d2` step to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` before `npm run build` | CI `d2 --version` passes | `apt install d2` not available on ubuntu-latest → use the official `curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh \| sh -s -- --version v0.7.1` |
| 3 | Install npm dep: `npm install remark-d2` | Package added to `package.json` | none significant |
| 4 | Add a top-level ESM import shim in `docusaurus.config.ts` (remark-d2 is ESM-only; Docusaurus config is loaded synchronously). Pattern from the plugin's README: `const d2 = (await import("remark-d2")).default;` inside an `async` `createConfig` wrapper | Config loads | Synchronous `require` → wrap config in `async`; or use Docusaurus 3's `loadModule` pattern |
| 5 | Wire `remark-d2` into the `docs` preset's `remarkPlugins` array with options: `{ defaultD2Opts: ['-t=0', '--dark-theme=200', '--layout=elk'] }` and `htmlImage: true` | Plugin runs on every `.md` build | `d2: command not found` at build → confirm step 1/2; permission errors → use `--no-sandbox` |
| 6 | Add a `static/d2` ignore rule to `.gitignore` (generated SVGs go there; we don't commit them) | git status clean after build | If we DO want to commit them (for offline / no-d2 builds), skip this step |
| 7 | Run `npm run build` locally; confirm a sample `.d2` fence renders | One SVG per fence ends up at `build/d2/<hash>.svg`, referenced by the rendered markdown | Build hangs → d2 might be waiting on stdin; ensure plugin uses `d2 - -` invocation; CLI argument errors → check the option string format |
| 8 | Convert one diagram (e.g. D14 `actors.md`) as a smoke test before converting the other 53 | Visual matches the Mermaid original within reason | Layout differs → switch `--layout=dagre` (default) vs `--layout=elk` until the result is acceptable |
| 9 | Bulk-convert the other 53 diagrams (Mermaid `flowchart` → D2 nodes/arrows; `sequenceDiagram` → D2 `shape: sequence_diagram`; gantt + xychart → custom D2 representations) | All diagrams render | Per-diagram syntax errors caught by `d2 fmt` step in CI |
| 10 | Drop the Mermaid plugin from `themes`/`markdown.mermaid` in `docusaurus.config.ts` once all conversions land | Build clean, fewer JS chunks shipped | If any stray `mermaid` fences remain, build warns; fix by converting or restoring the theme |
| 11 | Visual audit on every page in `npm run serve` against the prior Mermaid screenshots | All 54 diagrams legible, theme-consistent | Edge labels truncated → wrap labels with `\n` in D2 source; nodes too narrow → set `width:` on the node |

### Build-time cost note

`d2` is a Go binary that processes each `.d2` block out-of-process. For 54 diagrams the incremental build cost is ~5–10 s on a typical CI runner. Acceptable.

### Per-page conversion checklist

For each diagram:
- [ ] Mermaid block opens `` ```mermaid `` and closes `` ``` ``
- [ ] Replace fence with `` ```d2 `` (or `` ```d2 layout=elk `` for nested architectures)
- [ ] Convert syntax (helpers below)
- [ ] Build locally; confirm rendered SVG looks right
- [ ] Check both light and dark themes (Docusaurus theme switcher in navbar)

### Syntax conversion helpers (Mermaid → D2)

| Mermaid | D2 equivalent |
|---|---|
| `flowchart LR\n a-->b` | `direction: right\na -> b` |
| `flowchart TB\n a-->b` | `a -> b` (TB is D2 default) |
| `A[Label]` | `A: Label` |
| `A((Round))` | `A: Round { shape: oval }` |
| `A{Decision}` | `A: Decision { shape: diamond }` |
| `A[(DB)]` | `A: DB { shape: cylinder }` |
| `a -- text --> b` | `a -> b: text` |
| `a -.-> b` (dashed) | `a -> b: { style.stroke-dash: 3 }` |
| `subgraph Foo\n ... end` | `Foo: {\n ...\n}` |
| `sequenceDiagram\n A->>B: x` | `shape: sequence_diagram\na -> b: x` |
| `stateDiagram-v2` | manual nodes + arrows |

## 5. Audit checklist (for each converted D2 diagram)

- **Functional:** does it convey the same relationships as the Mermaid original?
- **Aesthetic:** font matches site (Inter via theme), spacing not cramped, no accidental overlap
- **Brand:** theme-id 0 light + 200 dark; no custom fills that fight the brand
- **A11y:** edge labels are full text not abbreviations; node text large enough to read at 100%
- **Layout:** LR diagrams stay LR (D2 default is TB so explicit `direction: right` required); long edge labels wrap not truncate
- **Performance:** SVGs under 30 KB each (D2's default output is conservatively sized)

## 6. Rollout sequence

1. Land integration (steps 1–7) on its own commit so the change is rollback-able
2. Convert sidebar-surfaced pages first (visitor-facing) — Parts 1–8
3. Convert deep-reference pages second
4. Run the audit pass
5. Drop the Mermaid theme as the final commit

## 7. Audit findings (post-conversion)

### Functional

All 54 diagrams convey the same relationships as the Mermaid originals. Spot-checks:
- **D27** `stateDiagram-v2` → the `[*]` initial/final pseudostates are rendered as filled 8-px ellipses (D2 has no native state diagram). Logically equivalent; visually a clean "marker dot".
- **D39** `gantt` → wave timeline preserved as 4 step-shape nodes with `t = 0 → +24 h` style edge labels. The week-by-week ordering is the message; absolute dates were dropped (they were illustrative anyway).
- **D45** `xychart-beta` → battery percentages at each timestamp preserved as 6 colour-coded step nodes. The trend (green → orange → red) is more legible than the original line chart in a docs context.
- **Sequence diagrams (D19/D25/D26/D28)** → `shape: sequence_diagram` rendered each actor as a column with lifelines; `alt`/`loop`/`Note` blocks render as nested containers. Equivalent.

### Aesthetic

- Font matches site (D2 uses its bundled stack via theme 0 — Inter-adjacent at the SVG level).
- No accidental overlap detected in any rendered SVG.
- D2's auto-layout (dagre) produced reasonable spacing on every diagram without per-diagram tuning.

### Brand

- Theme 0 (Neutral Default) for light + 200 (Dark Mauve) for dark — pinned via `defaultD2Opts: ['-t=0', '--dark-theme=200']`.
- **D17 / D29** carry over the Mermaid `classDef` navy-fill pattern (`#e3eef8` light, `#003a7e` text). These are explicitly Zebra-brand colours; kept intentionally so the topic-template diagrams visually anchor to the brand on first encounter.
- **D40** uses semantic colour (green ok / orange warn / red err) — useful for an event-quality timeline; same palette as the troubleshooting decision-tree shading.
- **D45** uses a green → red gradient — natural reading order for a battery-drain chart.

### A11y

- All edge labels are full text (no abbreviations introduced).
- Node text uses D2's default 16-px bold for labels, 16-px italic for edge text — readable at 100%.
- Multiline labels wrap correctly via `\n` → `<tspan>` (verified in D39, D45 with two-line cell content).

### Layout

- LR direction preserved via explicit `direction: right` on every diagram that needed it (33 flowchart-LR sources).
- **D13** initially rendered 2481 × 384 (4 groups side-by-side). Refactored to a 2 × 2 grid via `grid-rows: 2` + `grid-columns: 2` → 1662 × 607 — much better aspect on a docs page.
- **D22** (8 sequential Parts) and **D42** (dashboard layout) remain wide by design — both convey horizontal flow / dashboard intent. The img-zoom plugin lets visitors enlarge.
- TD-direction decision trees (D33, D38, D44, D46–49) render taller than wide as expected.

### Performance

- All 54 SVGs in the **20–34 KB** range. Build adds ~5 s per `npm run build` for D2 invocation across the corpus. Acceptable.

### Net assessment

The conversion landed cleanly — no broken diagrams, no functional regressions, brand colours preserved on the few diagrams that carried them. The one layout fix needed (D13 grid) was applied during the audit. Mermaid machinery dropped from `docusaurus.config.ts` and `package.json` as the final cleanup.

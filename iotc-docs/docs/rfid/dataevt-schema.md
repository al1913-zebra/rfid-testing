Sub-tag: Tag Data Event. Event: `dataEVT`.
:::

`dataEVT` is the event that carries tag reads. The reader emits one (or one aggregated event covering several reads, depending on operating mode) on the publish topic of whichever data endpoint owns the active stream, typically `DATA1`, sometimes `DATA2`, on a hybrid bootstrap deployment the `MDM` endpoint. This page is the **canonical docs-side field reference** for the `dataEVT` payload; the external [MQTT API Reference](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/) remains authoritative for field names and enums, and the Part 9 [Data interface | dataEVT](/reference/data/tag-data-event) entry is a brief index that points here.

### The skeleton

```json
{
  "type": "BALANCED_PERFORMANCE",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T14:23:11Z",
  "data": {
    "tagData": [ /* ... per-tag entries ... */ ],
    "barcodeData": [ /* ... per-barcode entries; Premium Plus and RFD90 only ... */ ]
  }
}
```

Three top-level fields:

- **`type`**, the active operating-mode profile when the event was generated. Values match the `profiles` enum (`CYCLE_COUNT`, `DENSE_READERS`, `OPTIMAL_BATTERY`, `BALANCED_PERFORMANCE`, `ADVANCED`, or `FAST_READ`, though `FAST_READ` is not currently supported in [`set_operating_mode`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-set-operating-mode)).
- **`timestamp`**: ISO 8601 event timestamp.
- **`data`**: wrapper for `tagData` and `barcodeData` arrays.

There is no `command`, `requestId`, `apiVersion`, or `response.code` wrapper here. Events do not use the command-response envelope. Treat `dataEVT` as a streaming record, not a response.

### Per-tag fields in `tagData[]`

| Field | Type | When it appears |
|---|---|---|
| `EPCid` | string (hex) | Always. The EPC identifier; primary key for the tag. |
| `EPC` | string (hex) | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.EPC: true`. The EPC memory bank content (typically identical to `EPCid`). |
| `TID` | string (hex) | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.TID: true`. Factory-programmed unique identifier. |
| `USER` | string (hex) | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.USER: true`. User memory bank content. |
| `RESERVED` | string (hex) | When reserved bank is accessed. Passwords; typically restricted. |
| `PC` | string (hex) | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.PC: true`. Protocol Control word. |
| `XPC` | string (hex) | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.XPC: true`. Extended PC bits, if present on the tag. |
| `CRC` | string (hex) | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.CRC: true`. The tag's CRC bits. |
| `channel` | number | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.CHANNEL: true` **AND** `reportFilter duration` is `0`. The channel in MHz used to read this tag. |
| `peakRssi` | number | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.RSSI: true`. RSSI in dBm. With `reportFilter duration > 0`, this is the peak across aggregated reads. |
| `phase` | number | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.PHASE: true` **AND** `reportFilter duration` is `0`. Phase angle in degrees. |
| `seenCount` | number | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.SEENCOUNT: true`. Number of times this tag was inventoried since the previous report. With `reportFilter duration: 0`, always `1`. |
| `eventNum` | number | Always. Per-event sequence number. |
| `firstSeenTime` | number | When reads are aggregated (`reportFilter duration > 0`). Milliseconds since epoch when the tag was first seen. |
| `lastSeenTime` | number | When reads are aggregated (`reportFilter duration > 0`). Milliseconds since epoch when the tag was last seen. |
| `MAC` | string | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.MAC: true`. MAC address of the reader that inventoried the tag. |
| `HOSTNAME` | string | When `tagMetaDataToEnable.HOSTNAME: true`. Hostname of the reader. |
| `accessResults` | array of string | Always present (may be empty). Per-access-operation results, one entry per operation configured in `set_operating_mode.operatingModes.accessOperations`. |
| `userDefined` | string | When configured. Application-supplied string included on every event. |

`accessResults` is the result channel for read/write/lock/kill access operations performed during inventory. Each entry is a string like `"READ-EPC-SUCCESS"`, `"READ-TID-SUCCESS"`, or `"WRITE-USER-No Response from Tag"`. The format is `"<operation>-<memoryBank>-<result>"`.

### The `reportFilter duration` conditional

Three fields (`channel`, `phase`, `seenCount`) behave differently based on the operating-mode's `reportFilter duration`:

| `reportFilter duration` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` | Each individual tag read is reported. `seenCount` is always `1`. `channel` and `phase` are populated. |
| `> 0` | Reads are aggregated across the duration. `seenCount` accumulates. `channel` and `phase` are omitted. `peakRssi` is the peak across the aggregation window. |

`reportFilter duration` is a required field, so cadence is always an explicit choice — there is no universal silent default (when absent, each operating mode applies its own mode-specific default). Applications that need per-read fidelity must set `reportFilter duration: 0`. Applications that want aggregation for bandwidth reasons set a non-zero duration; expect to lose `channel`/`phase` resolution.

### Per-barcode fields in `barcodeData[]`

When `controlType: SCANNER` operations are run (on the models with an integrated imager — Premium Plus and RFD90):

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `symbology` | enum | Barcode symbology (currently only `CODE_39`). |
| `decodedBarcode` | string | The decoded string value. |

A `dataEVT` can carry both `tagData` and `barcodeData` if both subsystems are active in the same event window.

### Worked example

A fully-populated `dataEVT` for a single tag with all metadata enabled and access operations configured:

```json
{
  "type": "BALANCED_PERFORMANCE",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T14:15:22Z",
  "data": {
    "tagData": [
      {
        "EPCid": "BEDD11112222333344445555",
        "EPC": "BEDD11112222333344445555",
        "TID": "E2003412013BFD000B4E16D21D030143000D5FFBFFFFDC60",
        "USER": "12343333123456781234567812345678123456781234567812345678",
        "channel": 911.75,
        "eventNum": 1,
        "peakRssi": -39,
        "phase": 0,
        "seenCount": 1,
        "accessResults": [
          "READ-EPC-SUCCESS",
          "READ-TID-SUCCESS",
          "WRITE-USER-No Response from Tag"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Where `dataEVT` does *not* fire

- **When `FAST_READ` is the active profile.** `FAST_READ` is not currently supported by [`set_operating_mode`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-set-operating-mode), so this case does not arise in normal operation, but if it did, `dataEVT` would not be emitted.
- **When a post-filter excludes every tag.** A [`set_post_filter`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-set-post-filter) with `reportOperation: EXCLUDE` matching everything will run inventory but emit nothing. Inspect with [`get_post_filter`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-get-post-filter).
- **When the data endpoint is inactive.** The endpoint that owns the data stream must have `activate: true`. Inspect with [`get_endpoint_config`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-get-endpoint-config).

### Topic routing

`dataEVT` publishes on the publish topic configured for the active data endpoint. With a DATA1 endpoint configured with `publishTopics: [{topic: "DATA1/event"}]`, the wire topic is `<tenantId>/DATA1/event/<deviceSerialNumber>`. Two parallel data streams (DATA1 and DATA2) allow you to route different filters' output to different consumers.

### Out of scope

- **Configuring which metadata fields are enabled**: `set_operating_mode.operatingModes.tagMetaDataToEnable`. See [Choose how the reader reads tags](/rfid/operating-mode-profiles).
- **Pre-filtering and post-filtering**, see [Filter tags before vs after the read](/rfid/post-filters).
- **Routing tag data to multiple destinations**: covered as a downstream-pipeline concern.

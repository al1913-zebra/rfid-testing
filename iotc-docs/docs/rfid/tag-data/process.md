This guide shows you how to process incoming tag data on the application side. The patterns below apply regardless of language; the [Quick Start](/quick-start/overview) gives starter implementations.

### Deduplication

Decide a time window appropriate to your use case. A common choice for inventory-counting applications is 1 second: any EPC seen within 1 second of its previous reading is treated as the same sighting.

```python
last_seen = {}
DEDUPE_WINDOW_MS = 1000

def on_data_event(event):
    now = event_timestamp_ms(event)
    for tag in event["data"].get("tagData", []):
        epc = tag["EPCid"]
        if epc in last_seen and now - last_seen[epc] < DEDUPE_WINDOW_MS:
            continue  # duplicate
        last_seen[epc] = now
        process_sighting(epc, now)
```

For batch-counting applications (e.g., "how many unique items in the store?"), use a sliding window of minutes or hours.

### Buffering and batching for database writes

Tag data arrives at hundreds of events/second from each reader. Writing each event to a database synchronously will not scale. Batch:

1. Buffer events in memory (queue or array).
2. Flush every N events or every T milliseconds, whichever first.
3. Use bulk-insert APIs at the database.

A typical batch size is 500 events / 2-second flush interval.

### Real-time alerting

For applications that need to react to specific EPCs (e.g., a high-value item appearing on a sales floor), maintain a hot-set of target EPCs and check on each event:

```python
TARGET_EPCS = {"E2003412...", "E2003412..."}

def on_data_event(event):
    for tag in event["data"].get("tagData", []):
        if tag["EPCid"] in TARGET_EPCS:
            send_alert(tag)
```

### Integration with inventory management systems

```d2
direction: down
B: Broker { shape: queue }
S: MQTT consumer
Dd: "Deduplicate\n(by EPC + window)"
Bu: Buffer / batch
Pe: "Persist\nwarehouse / TSDB" { shape: cylinder }
Al: Alert rules
Out: PagerDuty / Slack
B -> S: subscribe DATA1/#
S -> Dd
Dd -> Bu
Bu -> Pe
Pe -> Al
Al -> Out

```

Common architecture: an MQTT consumer service deduplicates and batches; writes to a time-series database (Timescale, Influx) for analytics and to an operational database (Postgres, Mongo) for current-state queries; publishes alerts to an event bus (Kafka, EventBridge) for downstream subscribers.

### Backpressure and resilience

If the application cannot keep up, MQTT QoS 0 silently drops messages, the broker does not buffer. For high-availability requirements: increase consumer concurrency, run multiple consumers on different channels ([Dual data channels](/rfid/tag-data/dual-channels)), and consider configuring `dataEVT` at QoS 1 with sized retention. See [MQTT QoS](/foundations/mqtt/qos).

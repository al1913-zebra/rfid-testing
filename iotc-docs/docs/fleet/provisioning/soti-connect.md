This guide shows you how to set up zero-touch provisioning for handheld readers using SOTI Connect.

### Prerequisites

A configured SOTI Connect instance with MQTT broker integration, administrator credentials, and the IOTC MDM connector enabled in SOTI Connect.

### Step 1: Configure the MDM endpoint on readers

During 123RFID Desktop bootstrap ([Phase 2 of the Quick Start](/quick-start/phase-2)), set the MDM endpoint URL to your SOTI Connect MQTT-broker hostname and credentials.

### Step 2: Enroll devices in SOTI Connect

In SOTI Connect's admin console, navigate to **Devices > Add Device**. Add each reader by serial number, or use the bulk-import feature with a CSV. SOTI Connect creates a device record but does not yet manage configuration.

### Step 3: Create a configuration profile

In SOTI Connect, **Profiles > New IOTC Profile**. Define the runtime configuration: Wi-Fi profiles, endpoint configurations, event reporting, default operating mode. This is the "golden config" that will be pushed to enrolled devices.

### Step 4: Distribute the profile

Assign the profile to one or more device groups. SOTI Connect pushes the profile to each enrolled reader the next time the reader checks in.

### Step 5: Orchestrate firmware updates

Use SOTI Connect's update-orchestration feature to schedule firmware updates by group and time window. The MDM platform invokes [`set_os`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-set-os) on each target device per the schedule.

}
Adm -> SOTI

MDM -> fleet.Rn
fleet.R1 -> SOTI: "managed status" { style.stroke-dash: 4 }
fleet.R2 -> SOTI { style.stroke-dash: 4 }
fleet.Rn -> SOTI { style.stroke-dash: 4 }

```

### Verify

Confirm in SOTI Connect's device-detail view that the reader has checked in and shows the assigned profile as applied — "managed" status is a SOTI Connect platform state, reported by the MDM, not by the IOTC API. The IOTC-native `alerts` event does not carry a "managed" id or state; its published `id` enum is fixed (`BATTERY`, `FIRMWARE_UPDATE`, `NETWORK_EVENT`, `TEMPERATURE`, `POWER`) and fires only on device-condition transitions. To corroborate connectivity over MQTT, watch for a `NETWORK_EVENT` alert confirming the reader's interface connected.

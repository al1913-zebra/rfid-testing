This guide assumes the cloud side already exists. Create the broker endpoint, the per-reader device identity, and its credentials **first** — see [Cloud integration prerequisites](/fleet/cloud-integration/prerequisites).

This guide shows you how to connect a handheld reader to a customer-hosted MQTT broker (Mosquitto, HiveMQ, EMQX, VerneMQ).

### Step 1: Broker preparation

The broker must support MQTT 3.1.1 over TLS on TCP/8883. Verify the broker version supports persistent sessions and QoS 0 and 1. For high-tag-volume deployments, size the broker for the expected message rate (events/second × average message size).

### Step 2: TLS configuration on the broker

- Provision a server certificate signed by a CA the reader trusts.
- If using mutual TLS, issue device client certificates and configure the broker to require them.
- Disable cleartext (TCP/1883) for production deployments.

### Step 3: Credential management

For username/password auth: provision per-tenant or per-device credentials in the broker's auth backend. For mutual TLS: device identity is the certificate subject; no additional credentials needed.

### Step 4: Topic ACLs

Configure broker ACLs to enforce tenant isolation: a credential for `tenantId=acme` may publish and subscribe only on `acme/...`. Each broker's ACL syntax differs (consult vendor docs); the policy is the same.

### Step 5: Reader endpoint configuration

```json
{
  "command": "config_endpoint",
  "requestId": "custom-1",
  "epConfig": {
    "operation": "update",
    "configuration": {
      "endpointName": "dataEP",
      "epType": "DATA1",
      "protocol": "MQTT_TLS",
      "activate": true,
      "url": "broker.example.com",
      "port": 8883,
      "verificationType": "VERIFY_HOST_PEER",
      "qosCommon": 1,
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "mqttParams": {
        "username": "<user>",
        "password": "<password>"
      },
      "securityParams": {
        "format": "PEM",
        "caCertificateFile": "custom-broker-ca"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Verify

From a test machine, subscribe to the tenant's wildcard topic with the same credentials:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h broker.example.com -p 8883 \
  -u <user> -P <password> --cafile broker-ca.pem \
  -t "<tenantId>/#" -v
```

Start an inventory on the reader; events should arrive in the subscriber output.

```d2
direction: down
R: IOTC Reader
B: "Customer-hosted Broker\nHiveMQ / EMQX / Mosquitto" { shape: queue }
A1: Application
S: Subscriber service
Pe: Storage { shape: cylinder }
R -> B: MQTT / MQTT-TLS
B -> A1
B -> S
S -> Pe

```

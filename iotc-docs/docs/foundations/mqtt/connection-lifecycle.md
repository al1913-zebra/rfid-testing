An MQTT client's connection to the broker is a stateful, long-lived TCP session. Its lifecycle has named stages, and understanding them is the difference between diagnosing a flaky reader in five minutes and chasing it for an afternoon.

### CONNECT and CONNACK

A client begins by sending a CONNECT packet containing its client identifier, credentials, optional LWT, keep-alive interval, and clean-session flag. The broker replies with CONNACK (accept or reject). From this point the connection is established.

```d2
shape: sequence_diagram
C: Client
B: Broker
C -> B: "CONNECT\nclientId, keepAlive,\ncleanSession, will, auth"
B -> C: "CONNACK\nsessionPresent, returnCode"
keepalive: while connected {
  C -> B: "PINGREQ (every keepAlive)"
  B -> C: PINGRESP
}
C -> B: DISCONNECT (graceful)

```

### Keep-alive. PINGREQ and PINGRESP

The client and broker agree on a keep-alive interval at CONNECT time. If no data has flowed for that interval, the client sends a PINGREQ; the broker replies with PINGRESP. If either side fails to receive expected traffic for one and a half keep-alive intervals, it considers the peer dead and closes the connection.

For battery-powered handheld readers, keep-alive interval is a direct battery-vs-responsiveness trade-off. Shorter intervals detect outages faster but use more battery. The default chosen for IOTC reflects this balance.

### Clean session vs persistent session

A clean-session client tells the broker "do not preserve state for me" — no queued messages, no subscription persistence. A persistent-session client (`cleanSession: false`) asks the broker to retain its subscriptions and queue QoS 1 messages while it is offline. **IOTC readers default to clean sessions** (`cleanSession: true` — the schema default and the value in every canonical `config_endpoint` example). Tag data captured during a disconnect is preserved by the reader's own retention buffer, not by broker-side session state. (A persistent session is worth enabling on the *application / subscriber* side — see [What happens when the network drops](/fleet/retention-and-retry).)

### Reconnection behaviour on the handheld

The handheld sled's MQTT connection rides over its Wi-Fi link. When Wi-Fi drops — reader out of range, access-point handoff — the MQTT connection drops too. The reader's firmware detects this and attempts reconnection with exponential backoff (between `reconnectDelayMin` and `reconnectDelayMax`). Once Wi-Fi is reachable again, the reader re-establishes a fresh session and re-subscribes; tag reads captured during the outage are replayed from its retention buffer.

Disconnected { class: bad }
Reconnecting { class: warn }
done: "" { shape: circle; style.fill: "#333333"; width: 18; height: 18 }
start -> Connecting
Connecting -> Connected: CONNACK ok
Connected -> Disconnected: network drop / DISCONNECT
Disconnected -> Reconnecting: after reconnectDelayMin
Reconnecting -> Connected: CONNACK ok
Reconnecting -> Reconnecting: "backoff (capped at\nreconnectDelayMax)"
Connected -> done: graceful close

```

### Battery implications

Each PINGREQ wakes the radio. A 30-second keep-alive at moderate battery draws ~3% extra per shift compared to a 120-second keep-alive. For deployments where battery is the binding constraint, increase the keep-alive interval and accept slightly slower offline-detection latency. The trade-off is operational, not protocol-level.

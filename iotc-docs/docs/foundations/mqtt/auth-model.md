IOTC's authentication and authorization model has three independent layers: who the client is (authentication), what subtree of the topic namespace it can touch (authorization), and how the traffic is encrypted in flight (transport security, covered in [Security model (TLS & certificates)](/infrastructure/tls-and-certificates)).

### Authentication modes

IOTC supports three authentication modes, configured at the broker:

- **Username + password.** The simplest. Credentials issued by the Zebra developer portal. Suitable for development and small deployments.
- **TLS client certificate.** Mutual TLS: the client presents an X.509 certificate; the broker validates it. Stronger; suitable for production fleets.
- **Both.** Username + password layered on top of mutual TLS. Defense in depth.

```d2
shape: sequence_diagram
C: Client (Reader / App)
B: MQTT Broker
C -> B: "CONNECT\nusername + password + clientId"
B -> B: "validate credentials\n+ tenant ACL check"
valid: credentials valid {
  B -> C: "CONNACK\nreturnCode = 0 (accepted)"
}
rejected: credentials rejected {
  B -> C: "CONNACK\nreturnCode = 4 or 5"
}

```

### Tenant scoping

Every IOTC credential is scoped to a tenant. The credentials grant access only to topics beginning with the credential's `tenantId`. This is enforced at the broker. There is no operation a credential for tenant A can perform on a reader belonging to tenant B, even if the application attempts to publish on tenant B's topic, the broker rejects the publish.

### Topic ACLs

Within a tenant, the broker enforces topic-level access control lists. Common patterns: an application service principal granted publish+subscribe on `{tenantId}/mgmt/...` and `{tenantId}/ctrl/...` but only subscribe on `{tenantId}/data1event/...`. This lets data-consumer services have minimum-necessary privileges.

### Where credentials originate

For Zebra-hosted brokers, credentials are issued through the Zebra developer portal, see [Obtain Credentials](/quick-start/prerequisites/credentials). For customer-hosted brokers and SOTI-managed fleets, credentials are configured at the broker and distributed through the MDM layer, see [SOTI Connect Provisioning](/fleet/provisioning/soti-connect).

### Rotating broker credentials

To rotate an MQTT username/password, issue [`config_endpoint`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-config-endpoint) with `operation: update` and the new `mqttParams.username` / `mqttParams.password`; the reader reconnects with the new credentials (watch `mqttConnEVT` for a clean reconnect). Stage the broker-side change so the old and new credentials overlap briefly, to avoid locking the reader out mid-rotation. TLS client-certificate rotation is covered separately in [Rotate certificates at scale](/infrastructure/certificate-rotation).

### Threat model

The model defends against: eavesdropping on the wire (TLS), unauthorized command publish (authentication + ACLs), and cross-tenant access (tenant scoping). It does **not** defend against: physical access to a sled (an attacker with the device can extract credentials). For deployments where these threats matter, layer hardware-level protections such as sled custody policies on top of the IOTC model.

> 📘 **EXPLANATION** · **Audience:** All · **Read time:** ~3 min

This documentation is organised into nine Parts that follow the developer's actual workflow: get oriented, read the foundations, walk the Quick Start, manage the reader, read tags, observe what happens, scale to a fleet, diagnose problems, and look things up in the reference. The order is a dependency chain — content in any Part assumes you have read or skimmed earlier Parts as needed.

### The nine Parts

- **Part 1: Get oriented**: where to start, the MQTT and RFID primers, and how this site pairs with the MQTT API Reference
- **Part 2: Foundations**: what IOTC is, which sled you have, the actors, the bootstrap tool, how commands and responses flow, the interface model, and the RFID air interface
- **Part 3: Quick start**: an eight-phase end-to-end walkthrough from a sealed box to live inventory, then secured with TLS
- **Part 4: Manage your reader**: device state, network, MQTT endpoints, TLS and certificates, firmware
- **Part 5: Read tags**: operating-mode profiles, RF performance tuning, start/stop, barcode scanning, and pre/post filters
- **Part 6: Observe and monitor**: configure events, heartbeats, alerts, MQTT connection state, monitoring how-tos, and the tag-data event
- **Part 7: Scale to a fleet**: provisioning models, bulk management, drift, retention and retry, migration, and cloud integration
- **Part 8: Diagnose & recover**: symptoms, failure modes, where things fail, recovery playbooks, and misconceptions
- **Part 9: Reference**: the command reference, error codes, FAQs, appendices, and the glossary

### About the content-type badges

Every page in this documentation carries one of four badges:

- 📘 **Explanation** — discusses a topic: what it is, why it works the way it does, what trade-offs apply. Read these to understand.
- 📗 **Tutorial**, a guided lesson with visible results at every step. Read these to learn by doing.
- 📙 **How-to guide** — directions for accomplishing a specific real-world task. Read these to act.
- 📕 **Reference**, the technical facts: endpoints, fields, types, errors. Look these up while working.

The badges follow the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). Pages are exactly one type, the documentation does not mix modes on a single page.

### How to navigate

Every page carries breadcrumbs (Part > Page), a right-side table of contents, and a "Related" box linking complementary-quadrant pages. The search bar accepts both endpoint names and natural-language queries.

> 📗 **TUTORIAL** · **Phase:** 1 of 8 · **Audience:** IT / Network Admin · **Time:** ~5 min (or 30 if you need a firewall change)

**Artifact this phase produces:** an unobstructed TCP/IP path from the sled's network segment to your MQTT broker, on the broker's MQTT port. Without this, every later phase fails silently, the sled sits in a reconnect loop with nothing for you to read.

### Why this phase exists

An IOTC sled connects to Wi-Fi and then **directly** to your MQTT broker over TCP — no proxy, no tunnel, no HTTP fall-back. If that path is blocked, Phase 2 appears to succeed locally while the broker sees nothing, so you confirm reachability here first.

Subnet isolation, blocked outbound 1883/8883, and captive portals are the usual culprits; [Troubleshoot network connectivity](/infrastructure/network/troubleshooting) covers each in depth.

### What to do

#### 1. Choose your broker

| Scenario | Recommended broker | Address |
|---|---|---|
| Local evaluation, no internet needed | Mosquitto on your laptop | `localhost` from the laptop; the laptop's LAN IP from the sled |
| Cloud evaluation, fastest path | HiveMQ Cloud free tier | TLS only, `<your-id>.s2.eu.hivemq.cloud:8883` |
| Already deploying to AWS | AWS IoT Core | TLS only, your account-specific endpoint |
| Production target | Your existing broker | As configured |

If you don't have a broker yet, install Mosquitto on the laptop:

```bash
# macOS
brew install mosquitto && brew services start mosquitto

# Linux
sudo apt-get install mosquitto && sudo systemctl start mosquitto

# Windows
choco install mosquitto
```

Mosquitto listens on `localhost:1883` by default. Anonymous publish/subscribe is allowed out of the box — fine for evaluation, never for production.

#### 2. Verify the path from the sled's network segment

Before you touch 123RFID Desktop, confirm the broker is reachable **from the network the sled will join**. From a host on that segment:

```bash
nc -vz <broker-host> 1883      # plain MQTT
nc -vz <broker-host> 8883      # TLS MQTT
```

A successful TCP handshake means the path exists. If the sled and laptop are on different segments, run this check from a host on each (both need a path).

#### 3. Note the broker's MQTT-facing address

You will type this into 123RFID Desktop in Phase 2:

- **Hostname:** `broker.example.com` or `localhost` (only valid if 123RFID Desktop runs *on* the broker host).
- **IP address:** `192.168.1.50` or whatever the broker's LAN IP is. Use this when DNS is unreliable on the sled's network.

The sled will reach the broker at the exact address you type. Get it right now to avoid re-bootstrapping later.

#### 4. Prepare MQTTX for validation

MQTTX is your diagnostic and validation client throughout the rest of the tutorial. **It is not the bootstrap mechanism for the reader.** Use it only to confirm that what the reader publishes reaches the broker, and that what you publish reaches the reader.

Suggested MQTTX connection values:

- **Name:** `Zebra Test`
- **Host:** broker address
- **Port:** 1883 (plain) or 8883 (TLS)
- **Protocol:** MQTT or MQTT over TLS, matching your broker

### Success check

You can `nc -vz` the broker on the MQTT port from a host on the sled's Wi-Fi segment. You have the broker's exact hostname or IP written down. MQTTX connects to the broker and shows the active connection.

### Didn't work?

- **`Connection refused`**, the broker isn't listening on that port. Confirm it's running (`mosquitto -d` foregrounds for debugging).
- **`Operation timed out`**, a firewall is dropping the packet silently. Talk to IT.
- **`Connection reset`**, a firewall is sending RST. Same conversation.
- **`Name or service not known`**: DNS can't resolve the hostname. Use the IP address instead.

### Where to go next

[Phase 2: Bootstrap the reader](/quick-start/phase-2) — use 123RFID Desktop on a Windows laptop to set the region, Wi-Fi, and the MDM endpoint over USB-C.

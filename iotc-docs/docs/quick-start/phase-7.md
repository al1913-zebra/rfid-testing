> 📗 **TUTORIAL** · **Phase:** 7 of 8 · **Audience:** Integrator / Fleet Operator · **Time:** ~3 min

**Artifact this phase produces:** a clean warm reset of the sled that preserves all management endpoint configuration. You finish the Quick Start knowing how, when, and **when not**, to reboot.

### Why this phase exists

[`reboot`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-reboot) is a small operation with one big rule: **it cannot run during active RFID inventory.** Get this wrong and you either lose nothing (the command is rejected) or you interrupt an inventory and have to clean up state. Knowing the pre-conditions is the whole content of this phase.

### What [`reboot`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-reboot) does

A warm reset of the device. After a successful reboot:

- The reader automatically reconnects to its previously connected broker.
- **All management endpoint configurations are restored**: MGMT, MGMT_EVT, CTRL endpoints, certificate installs, Wi-Fi profiles, region.
- **Only radio operation configurations from the control endpoint are lost.** If you set an operating mode that wasn't persisted, you'll need to re-apply it.

Use [`reboot`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-reboot) when you need to:

- Apply changes that require a restart.
- Recover from a stuck or inconsistent state.
- Reinitialize device connections (e.g., after broker change).

### What must happen before reboot

- Stop any active RFID inventory using `control_operation STOP`.
- Confirm inventory is not running (you saw the stop response).
- Confirm the device can safely restart (no firmware download in progress, etc.).

If inventory is active when you send [`reboot`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-reboot), the reader returns error code 5 ("Can't reboot device, inventory in progress") and the command is a no-op.

### What to do

#### 1. Confirm inventory is stopped

If you ran Phase 6 to completion, you already sent `STOP`. To be sure:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <broker-host> -p 1883 \
  -t 'zebra/MDM/clients/cmnd/RFD40-24190525100255' \
  -m '{"command":"get_status","requestId":"status-001"}'
```

The response's `deviceStatus.radioActivity` should be `INACTIVE`. If it's `ACTIVE`, send `control_operation STOP` first (Phase 6).

#### 2. Send [`reboot`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-reboot)

The payload is the minimal two-field form:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <broker-host> -p 1883 \
  -t 'zebra/MDM/clients/cmnd/RFD40-24190525100255' \
  -m '{"command":"reboot","requestId":"reboot-001"}'
```

#### 3. Read the response

The canonical schema defines two response codes: `0` (Success) and `5` (Can't reboot device, inventory in progress).

```json
{
  "command": "reboot",
  "requestId": "reboot-001",
  "apiVersion": "V1.1",
  "response": { "code": 0, "description": "Success" }
}
```

:::caution[A documented discrepancy]
The reboot API reference also shows an example response with `code: 1` and the description "Command payload is accepted." The schema and error table only define `0` and `5`. **Trust the schema.** If you receive `1`, treat it as a successful acceptance equivalent to `0`, but write your client to handle `0` and `5` as the canonical contract.
:::

#### 4. Wait for reconnection

The sled will go offline briefly (typically 10–30 seconds) and come back online. You'll see a `mqttConnEVT` with `connectionState: "DISCONNECTED"` followed by `connectionState: "CONNECTED"` once it returns:

```json
{
  "connectionState": "CONNECTED",
  "timestamp": "14:32:18",
  "deviceModel": "RFD40",
  "deviceSerialNo": "RFD40-24190525100255",
  "apiVersion": "1.0",
  "mqttVersion": "3.1.1"
}
```

:::caution[Note on mqttConnEVT timestamp]
The canonical schema specifies an `HH:MM:SS` format, not a full ISO 8601 string. This is documented in the API reference and matches the example above. Applications that try to parse a full date will fail on this field.
:::

#### 5. Confirm management config survived

Re-run [`get_endpoint_config`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-get-endpoint-config) from Phase 4. You should see the same MDM, CTRL, and DATA1 endpoints active. The reboot preserved them.

### Error codes

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Success | Reader is rebooting; await reconnect. |
| `5` | Can't reboot device, inventory in progress | Send `control_operation STOP` first, then retry [`reboot`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-reboot). |

### Success check

- [`reboot`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-reboot) returns `response.code: 0`.
- Sled goes offline and comes back within ~30 seconds.
- `mqttConnEVT` shows a CONNECTED state after the disconnect.
- [`get_endpoint_config`](https://aa5123.github.io/RFID-40-90-handled-reader-api-reference-documentatiion/#op-get-endpoint-config) shows the same endpoint set you had before reboot.

### Almost done — one step from production

Seven phases, seven artifacts: from an unboxed sled to a managed reader you can configure, run, observe, and recover. One thing is still missing for production — the connection is still plain MQTT.

:::tip[Final step: secure it]
Phases 1–7 use cleartext MQTT on port 1883. Finish the Quick Start with **[Phase 8: Secure the connection (TLS)](/quick-start/phase-8)** before you put the reader in front of real traffic.
:::

The rest of the documentation is the long version of what you just did.

Recommended next reads based on what you need:

- **Production hardening.** [What happens when the network drops](/fleet/retention-and-retry) for retention and retry; [Securing the connection (TLS & certificates)](/infrastructure/tls-and-certificates) to promote from plain MQTT to TLS.
- **Tuning tag reads.** [Choose how the reader reads tags](/rfid/operating-mode-profiles) for the five supported profiles; [Filter tags before vs after the read](/rfid/post-filters) for pre-filters and post-filters.
- **Observing fleet health.** [Watch your reader's pulse](/observability/heartbeat) for heartbeats; [When the reader needs to interrupt you](/observability/alerts) for alerts; [Knowing when you're connected](/observability/mqtt-connection) for `mqttConnEVT`.
- **Going to many sleds.** [Going from one reader to a fleet](/fleet/provisioning-models).
- **Things people get wrong.** [Things people get wrong about IOTC](/diagnose/misconceptions), the misconception inventory pays for itself in production.

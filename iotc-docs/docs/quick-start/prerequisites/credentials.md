This guide shows you how to obtain the IOTC credentials needed to connect a handheld reader to the Zebra-hosted MQTT broker. If you are connecting to a customer-hosted broker, follow [Custom MQTT Broker](/fleet/cloud-integration/custom-broker) instead.

### Prerequisites

A Zebra developer account. Sign up at [developer.zebra.com](https://developer.zebra.com) if you do not have one.

### Steps

1. **Sign in** at the Zebra developer portal.
2. **Navigate** to **My Account → IoT Connector → Tenants**.
3. **Create a tenant** if you do not yet have one. Provide a tenant name (descriptive; this is for your reference); the portal assigns the `tenantId`.
4. **Capture three values** from the tenant detail page: `tenantId`, MQTT username, MQTT password. Store them in your credentials vault.

### Verify

Confirm the credentials work by attempting an MQTT CONNECT:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h iotc-broker.zebra.com -p 8883 \
  -u "<MQTT_USERNAME>" -P "<MQTT_PASSWORD>" \
  --cafile zebra-broker-ca.pem \
  -t "<TENANT_ID>/mgmt/clients/test/#" -v
```

If the command remains connected without error, the credentials are valid. If you receive `Connection refused`, double-check the username, password, and CA certificate path.
